Because of the collectible nature of the products we sell, we will not accept returns and all sales are considered final unless:\n\n(1) WRONG ITEM WAS SENT\n\nAlthough very unlikely, we'll get the situation corrected immediately! Return shipping on us. All returned merchandise must be in new (unopened), re-sellable condition, in its original retail packaging. Simply contact us through our contact form or email info@cooledtured.com\n\n(2) ITEM ARRIVED DAMAGED\n\nWe understand that as uncommon as it is, things happen.
